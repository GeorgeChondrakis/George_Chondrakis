# Hello there ðŸ‘‹

I am passionate about digital media in all forms (sound/video/animation/image) and here I will present you the projects I will work on during my learning journey in web development.

I spend a lot of time producing digital media and web development will help me connect all those media efficiently. I also love biking, hiking, playing music and watching movies.

ðŸ¤“ I'm currently learning front end development and I want to learn back end as well. ðŸ¤—

âœ¨ Practice makes you better in everything, so I ll let here this line just for reminder âœ¨
